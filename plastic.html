            <h2> Why is it Important to Recycle Plastic?</h2>
            <p><strong>🌱 Environmental Impact:</strong> Recycling plastic helps to reduce the amount of plastic waste
                that ends up in landfills and oceans. This action protects wildlife and marine ecosystems. Plastics that
                enter the ocean can break down into microplastics, which are harmful to marine life and can infiltrate
                the food chain.</p>
            <p><strong>💧 Resource Conservation:</strong> By recycling plastic, we conserve valuable natural resources
                like oil and gas that are used in the production of new plastics. Recycling also reduces the energy
                required to create new plastic products, helping to conserve energy.</p>
            <p><strong>🏭 Reducing Pollution:</strong> Recycling plastic reduces the greenhouse gas emissions and air
                pollution that are typically associated with the production of new plastic. This contributes to cleaner
                air and helps mitigate climate change.</p>
            <p><strong>💼 Economic Benefits:</strong> Recycling creates jobs and supports local economies. It also
                reduces the costs associated with waste management and disposal, making it a more economical choice for
                communities.</p>

            <h2>How is Plastic Recycled?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>🚛 Collection and Sorting:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>🗑️ Collection:</strong> Plastic waste is collected from households, businesses, and
                            recycling centers.</li>
                        <li><strong>🔍 Sorting:</strong> Plastics are sorted by type and color, typically using manual
                            labor or machines that differentiate between various types of plastic.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>🧼 Cleaning:</strong> The sorted plastic is cleaned to remove contaminants such as food
                    residue, labels, and adhesives. This step ensures that the recycled plastic is of high quality.</li>
                <li><strong>🪓 Shredding:</strong> Clean plastic is shredded into small pieces or flakes, making it
                    easier to process and melt down.</li>
                <li><strong>🔥 Melting and Pelletizing:</strong> The shredded plastic is melted into a molten form, then
                    cooled and formed into pellets. These pellets are used as raw material for manufacturing new plastic
                    products.</li>
                <li><strong>🏗️ Manufacturing New Products:</strong> The plastic pellets are used to create new
                    products, including clothing, furniture, containers, and packaging.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How to Recycle Plastic</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>✅ Check Local Guidelines:</strong> Verify what types of plastics are accepted by your local
                    recycling program. Each municipality has different rules and facilities for recycling.</li>
                <li><strong>🧽 Clean and Prepare:</strong> Rinse out containers and remove labels or lids. Clean plastic
                    helps ensure it is processed effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>🗂️ Sort Properly:</strong> Separate plastics by type if required by your local recycling
                    program. This often involves categorizing by the plastic resin code (the number inside the recycling
                    triangle).</li>
                <li><strong>📦 Drop-Off or Curbside Collection:</strong> Place recyclable plastics in the appropriate
                    curbside bin or drop them off at designated recycling centers.</li>
                <li><strong>🚫 Avoid Contamination:</strong> Avoid placing non-recyclable items or contaminated plastics
                    in recycling bins, as this can spoil the entire batch.</li>
            </ol>
